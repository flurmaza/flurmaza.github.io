            <li><span>Intended Audience:</span> Individuals who are already familiar with my artwork and are looking to support my work further.</li>

It is very important for me to show my artistic voice through my website because it is a one way medium for my audience-potential customers-to understand why I, as an artist and person, am unique in comparison to other artists</li>
