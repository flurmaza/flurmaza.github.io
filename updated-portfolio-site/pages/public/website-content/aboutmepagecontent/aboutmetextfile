# About Me
    About Me Section:
        Hiya! My name is Grace! I am an aspiring artist who specializes in digital painting, charcoal drawing, and acrylic painting. I grew up on the south coast of Long Island, NY. The water is where I feel most at home, especially when crabbing or body surfing at the beach. I attended Smith College and am now a student at the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University.
    My Art Journey Section:
        I have always loved working with my hands. I would sit and sew with my aunt when my cousins were playing soccer outside. I crocheted at recess and swapped my lunch period for a ceramics class in high school. I have always loved art. I only really started following that love in my junior year of high school when I began experimenting with mediums. First watercolor, then charcoal, acrylics, color pencils, digital art, and so on and so forth. In a perfect world I would master every art and every craft.
    Pets Section:
        Peanut:
            The golden boy of my puppies. A little corgi-weiner dog mix who loves zooming around open fields.
        Hamilton:
            The fiesty spitfire of the family. He's small but nasty. Classic Chihuahua energy if you catch my drift.
        Goose:
            My darling girl who is so sweet and spunky. A cute and old chihuahua-pug mix who loves to snort and roll around like a pig.
